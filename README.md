# rusty-os
I'm going to write a basic kernel in rust largely based on the blogposts at os.phil-opp.com.
Hopefully I will get to adding some stuff of my own.

Blos-os by Phill-opp
----------------------
2nd edition : https://os.phil-opp.com/ ( uses bootloader+bootimage which is slightly out of date )
1st edition : https://os.phil-opp.com/edition-1/ ( writes bootloader , which is a bit of a pain )

Upcomming third edition uses updated bootloader. has UEFI support
